				<h1>Spirituality</h1>
				<p> Spirituality and religious activities, in general, can be thought of as relating to or affecting the human spirit or soul, as opposed to material or physical things. Religion typically involves, in addition, a relationship with God or a higher power. Spirituality and religion can supply a robust and flexible framework for understanding the world and the self, which may foster increased tolerance to uncertainty, enhanced coping, resourcefulness, and optimism. Religions can also offer a community of support, which reduces social isolation.</p>

					<li>Transcendental meditation (TM)- Involves the use of a mantra, while sitting comfortably, twice daily with eyes closed for 15 to 20 minutes. TM has a spiritual dimension; its practice moves the mind away from physical affairs to a focus on the larger universe and the individual&#39s place within it.</li>
					<li>Qigong meditation- Is an ancient Chinese health practice that integrates movement, breathing, and meditation into one multifaceted practice. The meditative practice utilizes breath awareness, mantra, chanting, sound, visualization, and focus on concepts such as qi circulation, aesthetics, and moral values. Qigong treatment incorporates mind-body operational skills or techniques that integrate body, breath, and mind adjustments into Oneness. Qigong meditation focuses on the flow of qi, which is a universal, spiritual power that is a central force in all living things.</li>
